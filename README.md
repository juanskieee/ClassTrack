# Class Track
Task management is vital to the life of any student in an academic environment. 
As more demands in the course workload arise, students require comprehensive tools 
to  organize  assignments,  work  against  deadlines,  and  manage  study  schedules. 
Hence  the  programming  language  selected  to  develop  such  systems  plays  a  very 
major role in the effectiveness, maintainability, and performance of that system. This 
project will compare two backend languages—PHP and Java—that are well 
established  in  building  ClassTrack,  a  web-based  task  management  system  for 
students. In other words, we shall implement the same system in both languages in 
order to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the two regarding the development 
of educational software.  
PHP has been an old-time favorite for web development due to its ease of use 
and good integration with HTML and MySQL. Generic interpreted languages have a 
fast  development  cycle,  which  PHP  enjoyed  being  most  sought-after  for  its  rapid 
application  development.  Java  is  platform-independent  through  the  "write  once,  run 
anywhere"  mantra  and  has  excellent  and  diverse  enterprise  applications;  however, 
learning Java is not easy. ClassTrack will include functions mainly needed by students: 
assignment tracking by course, deadline notifications, scheduling of study sessions, 
grade  computation,  and  visualization  of  progress.  Both  implementations  will  use 
identical technologies in the frontend with variations in the backend architecture.
